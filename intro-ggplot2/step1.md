## `ggplot2`: a quick overview

The `ggplot2` package is an implementation of the ["Grammar of Graphics"](https://amzn.to/2MRRCAB) by Leland Wilkinson. This text outlines a foundation for understanding the components of just about every graph or figure we've encountered (and some we haven't). `ggplot2` extends these concepts into a powerful grammar for developing data visualizations in R.

### Why have a 'grammar' of data visualization?

[Wilhelm von Humboldt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_von_Humboldt) has described a language as a system for "*making infinite use of finite means.*" Grammar is the set of rules we use to generate and display comprehensible thought (to humans or computers). Within the R language, `ggplot2` provides the grammar (or set of rules) we can learn to develop a rich vocabulary for data visualizations. Knowing how to use `ggplot2`'s grammar also gives us an excellent mental model for thinking about individual graphical elements. 

### A lingua franca for graphical elements

We'll extend the definition of 'grammar' above to include Steven Pinker's description of language in [The Sense of Style](https://www.amazon.com/Sense-Style-Thinking-Persons-Writing/dp/0143127799), "*[language is] our speciesâ€™ solution to the problem of getting complicated thoughts from one head into another*." In this sense, the `ggplot2` package gives us an ability to communicate the *complexities* of our data in the same way that scientific jargon allows us to precisely and unambiguously define ideas. 

### Building graphs, bit-by-bit

Lastly, `ggplot2` has an expansive vocabulary, so by learning a finite list of `ggplot2` functions and their syntax will allow us to build a seemingly unlimited number of visualizations.
