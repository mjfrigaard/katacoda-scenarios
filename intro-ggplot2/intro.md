# Introduction to ggplot2

Welcome to "Building Beautiful, Customized Graphs and Charts in R with ggplot2!" In this scenario, we'll go over some basic graphing principles using the popular `ggplot2` package.

`ggplot2` is part of the `tidyverse`, which is a collection of opinionated packages from RStudio that ["you're likely to use in everyday data analyses."](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/)

## Exploring the data with ggplot2

In the [previous scenario](https://learning.oreilly.com/scenarios/-/9781492079064), we used the `tidyverse` and `fivethirtyeight` packages to wrangle data in R.

Now that we have some experience with data wrangling, we'll extend what we know into visualizing our data with the [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package.
