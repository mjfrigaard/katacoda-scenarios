# intro

## Exploring the data with ggplot2

In the previous scenario, we used the `tidyverse` and `fivethirtyeight` packages to wrangle data in R. 

<!-- insert link to previous scenario! -->

Now that we have some experience with data wrangling, we'll extend what we know into visualizing data with the [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package. 

# step 2

## `ggplot2`: a quick overview

The `ggplot2` package is an implementation of the ["Grammar of Graphics"](https://amzn.to/2MRRCAB) by Leland Wilkinson. 

**Why have a 'grammar' of data visualization?**

[Wilhelm von Humboldt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_von_Humboldt) described language as a system for "*making infinite use of finite means.*" 

Grammar is then a set of rules used to generate comprehensible sentences in a language (human or computer languages).

Within the R language, `ggplot2` provides a rich vocabulary for graphical elements. Knowing how to use `ggplot2`'s grammar gives an excellent mental model for thinking about data visualizations. 

### Composition of graphical elements

We'll extend the definition of 'grammar' above to include Steven Pinker's description in [The Sense of Style](https://www.amazon.com/Sense-Style-Thinking-Persons-Writing/dp/0143127799), "*[grammar is] our species’ solution to the problem of getting complicated thoughts from one head into another*." 

In this sense, the `ggplot2` package gives us an ability to communicate the *complexities* of our data in the same way that scientific jargon allows us to precisely and unambiguously define ideas. 

Lastly, `ggplot2` has an expansive vocabulary, so knowing a finite list of functions and their syntax unlocks an unlimited number of visualizations. 

# step 3

## Geoms and aesthetics

A geom (or geometric object) is, *"what you actually see on the plot: points, lines, polygons, etc.* 

These are combined with aesthetic mappings, which are *"properties that can be perceived on the graphic*" like color, size, position, and shape. 

I'll be using `ggplot2::qplot()`'s `geom = ` argument to explore data from The Economist's Medium post titled, ["Mistakes, we've drawn a few"](https://medium.economist.com/mistakes-weve-drawn-a-few-8cdd8a42d368). 

These data are available for download here as part of the [#TidyTuesday]() project. 

```{r importing-data}
# Brexit ----
# Brexit <- readr::read_csv("")
readr::write_csv(base::as.data.frame(Brexit), "data/Brexit.csv")

# Corbyn ----
# Corbyn <- readr::read_csv("")
readr::write_csv(base::as.data.frame(Corbyn), "data/Corbyn.csv")

# Dogs ----
# Dogs <- readr::read_csv("")
readr::write_csv(base::as.data.frame(Dogs), "data/Dogs.csv")

# EuBalance ----
# EuBalance <- readr::read_csv("")
readr::write_csv(base::as.data.frame(EuBalance), "data/EuBalance.csv")

# Pensions -----
# Pensions <- readr::read_csv("")
# readr::write_csv(base::as.data.frame(Pensions), "data/Pensions.csv")

# Trade -----
# Trade <- readr::read_csv("")
readr::write_csv(base::as.data.frame(Trade), "data/Trade.csv")

# WomenResearch -----
# WomenResearch <- readr::read_csv("")
readr::write_csv(base::as.data.frame(WomenResearch), "data/WomenResearch.csv")
```



### Using geoms with ggplot2::qplot()

Using the geoms in `ggplot2::qplot()` means supplying the `geom =` argument with a type of graph. The syntax looks like this:

```{r qplot-syntax, eval=FALSE}
Data %>% ggplot2::qplot(data = ., 
                      x = variable_x, 
                      y = variable_y,
                      geom = "shape")
```

The `data = .` argument is a product of the piping syntax. By placing the `data = .` on the right-hand side of the pipe operator (`%>%`), we are telling R to read this statement as, "*the object to the left of the `%>%` belongs in the `data` argument.*" See the figure below:

```{r IMAGE-pipe-data-args.png, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_ls("images")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/pipe-data-args.png")
```

The `geom = shape` will be replaced by a geom or type of graph (`"bar"`, `"point"`, "box")

In the [Mad Men article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/mad-men-is-ending-whats-next-for-the-cast/), the variables are described with the language below,

```{r MadMen}
MadMen <- fivethirtyeight::mad_men
MadMen %>% dplyr::glimpse(78)
```


> I zeroed in on the actors who had been on a defunct show or, if the program was still on the air, had left the show. This encompassed 248 performers, all of whom were given a score for their post-show career. They received:
>
> - 1 point for each season they regularly appeared on another TV show.
> - 1 point for each time they had a leading role in a film.
> - 0.25 points for each supporting role in a film.

The variables outlined above are `num_shows`, `num_lead`, `num_support`, and they give us the `score_div_y` (or *"Score" divided by "Years Since"*). The `score_div_y` and `years_since` then give us the total `score`. These data are presented in the article as a table, but I'll explore the `score` variable using two geoms from `ggplot2`. 

### The bar plot

Using the geoms in `ggplot2::qplot()` means supplying the `geom =` argument with a type of graph. 

A bar-plot might help us understand the distribution of `score` in the `MadMen` data. I can build this graph using the template above, substituting the `MadMen` for `Data`, `score` in the `x` variable position, and `"bar"` for `"shape"`.

```{r bar-plot}
MadMen %>% ggplot2::qplot(data = ., 
                        x = score, 
                        geom = "bar")
```

#### What is this graph telling us? 

The `geom = "bar"` displays the `score` values in the height of each bar (i.e. their `count`, as indicated by the `y` axis). These bars aren't equal heights, and the highest bar is at `0`. Fewer tall bars are on the right side of the graph (high `score`s), only four bars have a `count` higher than `10` (all are under `5`). 

The article indicated, "*The median actor in our set had a score of 2*", but it's not clear where the median value is in the bar-plot. To view how this statistic fits into the distribution of `score`, I will use the `geom = "boxplot"`.

### A box-plot

Change the code above to use a `geom = "boxplot"`, but map `score` to the `y` axis and give the `x` axis a blank character string (`" "`). 

```{r box-plot}
MadMen %>% ggplot2::qplot(data = ., 
                        x = " ", 
                        y = score,
                        geom = "boxplot") 
```


#### What is this graph telling us? 

Box-plots (or box and whisker plots) display five statistical concepts in a single graph. These were initially introduced by John Tukey in his 1977 book, ["Exploratory Data Analysis."](https://amzn.to/2t8lUWI)

<!-- The image below is a taken from page 41,  -->
<!-- ```{r IMAGE-og-box-whisker, echo=FALSE} -->
<!-- # fs::dir_ls("images") -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/og-box-whisker.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->

Box-plots display the five number summary, which includes the smallest, largest, median, and upper and lower quartiles (quartiles divide the numbers into a percentage, and the 25th and 75th are included on the graph). Box-plots also display 'outliers', or extreme values as dots or points. 

In order to get an idea of what I should be seeing on the graph, I will use the `base::summary()` function to list the `Min`, `1st Qu.`, `Median`, `Mean`, `3rd Qu.`, and `Max.` This is a five number summary plus the mean (or average).

```{r summary-score}
base::summary(MadMen$score)
```

The `Median` is the horizontal line within the box, and if I look over to the `y` axis, I can see this corresponds to a score of 2 (just like the article stated).

```{r IMAGE-box-plot-median, echo=FALSE}
# fs::dir_ls("images")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/box-plot-median.png")
```

Can you guess which bars in the bar-plot correspond to the points on the box-plot?

## Output the new tables as csv files

Use `write_csv(as.data.frame(x = Data, file = "path/to/file.csv"))` and voilá, you have a csv.

```{r tidy-export, eval=FALSE}
readr::write_csv(as.data.frame(MadMen), path = "data/MadMen.csv")
```

## A recap of what we learned

We used the pipe operator to string together various `tidyr` and `dplyr` functions for structuring our data (in tibbles). Remember that:

- `dplyr::arrange()` sorts the data in each column  

- `tidyr::separate()` divides the contents of a column apart into new *columns* 
- `tidyr::separate_rows()` split the contents of a column into new *rows* 
- `tidyr::unite()` sticks the contents from one column onto the contents of another column  

- `tidyr::gather()` collects and indexes data across columns and puts them into into rows 
- `tidyr::spread()` distributes indexed data from rows into columns  

- using `geom`s in `ggplot2::qplot()` 

- `base::summary()` to get the five number (and mean) 

In the next tutorial we will expand our `ggplot2` abilities.
