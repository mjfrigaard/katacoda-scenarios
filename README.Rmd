I will be creating three scenarios for using R in Katacoda. They are listed below:

*Scenario 1: Format and shape your data in R with the tidyverse*

*Scenario 2: Build beautiful, customized graphs and charts in R with ggplot2*

*Scenario 3: Combine narrative with numbers for effective storytelling in R*

This is the `README.Rmd` file for the Katacoda scenarios. All the scenarios and courses can be found on my profile page [here](https://katacoda.com/mjfrigaard).
