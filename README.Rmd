I will be creating three scenarios for using R in Katacoda. They are listed below:

## Scenario 1: Format and shape your data in R with the tidyverse

### intro 

This introduces the `tidyverse` and gives a little preview of what is to come. 

### step 1

Step 1 covers how to install and load packages in R. 

### step 2

This covers the Bob Ross dataset from 538, and using the tibble function to create a dataset in R. 

### step 3

Here we cover loading data into R from the `fivethirtyeight` package. 



### step 4

### step 5

### step 6

### step 7

### step 8

### step 9

### step 10

### step 11

### step 12

### finish

*Scenario 2: Build beautiful, customized graphs and charts in R with ggplot2*

*Scenario 3: Combine narrative with numbers for effective storytelling in R*

This is the `README.Rmd` file for the Katacoda scenarios. All the scenarios and courses can be found on my profile page [here](https://katacoda.com/mjfrigaard).
