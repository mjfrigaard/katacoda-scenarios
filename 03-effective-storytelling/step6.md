### Visualizations: start analog 

So far, we've focused on checking the quality of the data. After reviewing our data's overall structure (total columns and rows), the variable formats, and the observations (missing vs. complete), we're ready to start thinking about building graphs. Hopefully, we have an idea of the visualizations we want to develop, or at a minimum, we know what variables are of interest to our audience. Consider the following question: 

***Who is the greatest major league baseball (MLB) hitter?***

We're going to continue using the baseball database to answer the question, "*Who is the greatest major league baseball (MLB) hitter?*" At this point, we recommend sketching out some ideas on a piece of paper or a whiteboard. Send these ideas out for feedback from the stakeholders or potential audience members. Follow-up questions might include: 

1. How are we determining the term *greatest*?  
2. How are we deciding who was a *hitter*? (for example, do we only include designated hitters or all players?)  
3. Is there a specific time-frame we're using to answer this question? 

Sketching out ideas in some 'analog' graphs takes less time than writing code, and physically separating yourself from the keyboard, and computer screen often helps us think about the data in a more abstract way. We've found we can answer some questions using a simple summary table, while others will require complicated algorithms or models. 

#### Consider the audience

Who is asking this question? Is it someone looking to verify their favorite player is the best, or is it a [sabermetrician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabermetrics) looking to compare different performance metrics, or is it a sports journalist writing an article featuring top MLB sluggers over time? For this scenario, we will assume our audience is baseball fans, but they're not necessarily statisticians, so we should include plenty of descriptive information with the graphs.
