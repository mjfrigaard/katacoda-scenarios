### Welcome!

Welcome to '*Combine narrative with numbers for effective storytelling in R*'! In this scenario, we will cover how to build data visualizations that effectively communicate and engage your audience. 

Now that we have some experience with data wrangling with [`tidyr` and `dplyr`](https://katacoda.com/orm-mfrigaard/scenarios/01-format-shape-data), and [data visualization with `ggplot2`](https://www.katacoda.com/orm-mfrigaard/scenarios/02-intro-ggplot2), we can put these tools together to get your point across to stakeholders and audiences. 

### What makes a bad graphic?

Bad graphs aren't just ugly; they're misleading. A chart can have pretty colors and novel font styling, but that can't make up for inaccurately presenting data. Mislabeling axes, using inappropriate scales or labels, and including unnecessary elements ('chart junk') are common characteristics of bad graphics. 

*We'll be using the terms 'graph', 'figure,' and 'chart' interchangeably throughout this scenario.*

[Claus Wilke](https://twitter.com/clauswilke) describes the difference between *ugly*, *bad*, and *wrong* graphs in his excellent text, [Fundamental of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/). 

- An *ugly* graph isn't aesthetic appealing, but the data presented is clear and informative  
- A *bad* graph fails to communicate the information it contains because of poor design  
- A graph is *wrong* if it's mathematically incorrect (the underlying calculations, representations, or transformations are inaccurate).  

We want to avoid making ugly, bad, *and* wrong graphs.

#### What makes a great graphic?

Have you ever heard a joke and thought, "it's funny *because* it's true"?

We all know a great data visualization when we see it, but can you explain *why* it's so great? Beyond just being aesthetically appealing (the choice of color palettes, fonts, etc.), data visualizations are tools for communicating complicated information. 

Well, great graphics are similar to great jokes in this way--they should reveal a complicated 'truth' that was otherwise difficult to comprehend or articulate with words alone. 

This scenario will show you how to make sure your graphs and figures communicate complexity effectively without misleading your audience.
