### Welcome!

Welcome to '*Combine narrative with numbers for effective storytelling in R*'! In this scenario, we will cover building data visualizations that present data clearly to your audience.

Now that we have some experience with data wrangling with [`tidyr`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) and [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), and data visualization with [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), we can put these tools together to get your point across to stakeholders and audiences.

#### What makes a great graphic?

We all know a great data visualization when we see it, but can you explain *why* it's so great? Beyond just being aesthetically appealing (the choice of color palettes, fonts, etc.), data visualizations are tools for communicating complicated information.

Have you ever heard a joke and thought, "it's funny because it's *true*!"

Well, great graphics are similar to great jokes in this way--they should reveal a complicated 'truth' that was otherwise difficult to comprehend or articulate with words alone.

#### What makes a lousy graphic?

Bad graphs aren't just ugly; they're misleading. A figure can have pretty colors and novel font styling, but that can't make up for incorrectly presenting data. Mislabeling axes, using inappropriate scales or labels, and including unnecessary elements ('chart junk') are common characteristics of bad graphics.

[Claus Wilke](https://twitter.com/clauswilke) describes the difference between *ugly*, *bad*, and *wrong* graphs in his excellent text, [Fundamental of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/). An *ugly* graph isn't aesthetic appealing, but the data presented is clear and informative. A *bad* graph fails to communicate the information it contains because of poor design. A figure is *wrong* if it's mathematically incorrect (the underlying calculations, representations, or transformations are inaccurate).
