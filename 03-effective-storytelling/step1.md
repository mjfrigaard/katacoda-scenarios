### Things to consider about your audience

We need to determine before creating a graph or figure is who the audience or stakeholders will be. In most cases, our stakeholders or audience is whoever is getting the final results of our analysis. 

You'll likely create multiple graphs throughout a data analysis that you won't include as a final deliverable.  

The final graphs you produce will depend on 1) the question we've been asked, and 2) the level of [statistical literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_literacy#) of our audience. 

If our audience isn't familiar with particular data visualizations, we should consider it part of our job to educate them. However, if we find ourselves spending more time explaining a data visualization's design than what the visualization reveals, we should consider a different graph. 

Data visualization should be an iterative process, and getting regular feedback from your audience will help you understand their point of view. It will also help manage their expectations regarding the final deliverable.

The questions below can help guide your project and make sure you understand what your audience/stakeholders are expecting:

1. *What question(s) is this project trying to answer?* (or *What problem(s) is this project trying to solve?*)  
2. *Do we have access to the data to answer the question/problem posed?* (or do we need to gather more data?)  
3. *What is the current format/structure/location of the data?* (this will have an enormous impact on the project timeline!)
4. *What context will we present the deliverable(s) in?* (slide deck, website, report, etc.)  
5. *How familiar will the audience be with the data in our project?* (how much background information should we be providing?)

Having the answers to these questions documented will 1) keep your project focused and timely, 2) ensure both you and your client/customer have a clear vision for successful completion.
