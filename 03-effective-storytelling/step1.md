### Who is our audience?

The first thing we need to determine before creating a graph or figure is the audience or stakeholders. In most cases, our stakeholders or audience is whoever is getting the final results of our analysis.

It's normal to create multiple graphs throughout a data analysis, but not all are intended for the stakeholders. We should be making plenty of figures during exploratory data analysis (EDA). After we have a firm grasp of the measurements, variable distributions, and relationships, we can decide which graph communicates the findings.

While we're considering our audience, we should also consider the medium to present the results. Do we want our graphs static to put them in a slide deck, academic poster, or PDF report? Or will we want an interactive graph that gives users the ability to explore the data themselves? Knowing the answers to questions like these allows us to 'begin with an end in sight.'

#### What does our audience want to see?

It's not likely our audience will know *exactly* what they want to see. After all, it's sometimes hard to know what graphs will be in our final report until we've answered some basic questions about the data. However, it's safe to assume our audience will want figures that address the underlying question (or problem) that motivated our analysis. Sometimes this means returning to our scope of work or problem statement to refine our results.

Throughout the analysis project, its usually a good idea to
