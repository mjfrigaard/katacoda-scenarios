## Appendix 1: Katacoda scenario tutorials

The tutorial for building the scenario is
[here](https://katacoda.com/scenario-examples/scenarios/create-scenario-101).

I took notes on this tutorial and made them available in [this Google
document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSf2w2onhH5t3IhuD4sYLoWqn46BLKMYFR7q3BHO8QTaRkVgXfhKvnl8T9uHrjmbVpTZVKCWrfxEl0R/pub).

## Appendix 2: Katacoda guidelines

There are multiple guidelines and resources for writing scenarios.
O’Reilly has provided an *Authoring Guide* and *Formatting and Design
Guide*.

## Appendix 3: Scenario Checklist

**Scenario Readiness Checklist:**

When you think your scenario is ready for publication, we recommend you
run through the checklist below to ensure it is ready to go. \[Reminder:
We discuss these best practices in the Katacoda Formatting and Design
Guide for Authors\]:

Does the scenario start consistently and in a timely manner? More than 5
minutes to start would be cause to reconsider your build decisions.

  - [ ] Are your intro and final pages present and are their respective
    goals and lessons learned in agreement?

  - [ ] Have you tested your scenario lately?

  - [ ] Do you agree with the leveling (beginner, intermediate,
    advanced) you indicated when you started the build?

  - [ ] Was learning time you entered correct, or should it be adjusted?

  - [ ] Are your versions of tools and other dependencies up to date?

  - [ ] Have you tried every instruction?

  - [ ] Have you written each step in the most concise manner possible?

  - [ ] Have you run your text through a spelling/grammar checker?

  - [ ] Are your credits to others given present and correct?

  - [ ] Are your images legal and with credits?

  - [ ] Are your hyperlinks all working?

  - [ ] Do the goals and lessons learned items match the steps in the
    scenario?
