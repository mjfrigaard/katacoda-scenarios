This scenario will introduce how to use R to change columns from one type (or class) to another. In the wild, we rarely collect data in a format that they can be immediately analyzed or visualized in, so data wrangling is a common task.

## Variable types

Recall that variables can be characters (or strings), logicals (or boolean), and numbers (integer and double). In this first exercise, we'll be converting variables from one form to another using [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), a package from the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/).
