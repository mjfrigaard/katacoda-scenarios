## Taking notes?

It would also be great if the learners were able to use something like
[HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) to keep a copy of the code they’re writing?

## Resources

-   The Supported Layouts: This is the
    [documentation](https://www.katacoda.community/layouts.html) for the
    supported layouts

-   UI Layouts Examples: These are the supported [UI
    layouts](https://katacoda.com/scenario-examples/courses/uilayouts).

The two UI layouts that look the most promising are the [Scenario with
Terminal iFrame
UI](https://katacoda.com/scenario-examples/courses/uilayouts/uilayout-terminal-iframe)
and the [Visualise Environment
Tab](https://katacoda.com/scenario-examples/courses/uilayouts/visualise-docker)
