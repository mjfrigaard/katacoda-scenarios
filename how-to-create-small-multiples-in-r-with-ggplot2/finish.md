### How to Create Small Multiples in R with ggplot2

In this scenario we covered how to:

1. `skim()` variables to get summary statistics  
2. Create categorical variables using `mutate()` and `cut()`   
3. Build small multiple graphs with `ggplot2::facet_wrap()`  
4. Transform axes with `ggplot2::scale_x_log10()` and `label_log10()`  
4. Save graph images with `ggplot2::ggsave()`
