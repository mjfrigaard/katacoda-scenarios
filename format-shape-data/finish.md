# Thank you for completing this scenario!

We've gone over how to:

1. Load packages and data into R (`utils::install.packages()`, `base::library()`, `tibble::tribble()`, and `readr::read_csv()`).

2. how to use R to format and shape (or *reformat* and *reshape*) your data (`tidyr::pivot_longer()`, `tidyr::pivot_wider()`, `tidyr::separate()`, and `tidyr::unite()`).

3. how to create new variables based on existing columns `dplyr::mutate()` and `dplyr::if_else()`

4. how to create new variables based on multiple conditions (i.e. `dplyr::mutate()` and `dplyr::case_when()`)

5. how to check your work with counting and pivoting (`dplyr::count()` and `tidyr::pivot_wider()`)
