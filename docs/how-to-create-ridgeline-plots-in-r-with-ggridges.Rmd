# intro.md

## Welcome!

Welcome to "How to Create Ridgeline Plots in R with ggridges"! In this scenario, we will cover how to build a _ridgeline_ plot of a continuous variable across a categorical variable.

This scenario assumes you've done some data wrangling with [`tidyr` and `dplyr`](https://learning.oreilly.com/scenarios/-/9781492079064), and [data visualization with `ggplot2`](https://learning.oreilly.com/scenarios/-/9781492079071).

## Knowing your Data

It's best to start a project off with a "view of the forest from outside the trees." The technical term for this is [data lineage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lineage#), which:

> "Includes the data origin, what happens to it, and where it moves over time."

Having a "bird's eye view" of the data ensures there weren't any problems with exporting or importing. Data lineage also means understanding where the data is coming from (e.g., a relational database, API, flat _.csv_ files, etc.).

## Tabular Data

Knowing some of the technical details behind a dataset lets us frame the questions or problems we're trying to tackle. In this scenario, we will use [tabular data](http://bit.ly/3aXXB4I) data (i.e., [spreadsheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet)). Tabular data organizes information into columns and rows.

Let's load some data and get started!


# step1.md

## Initiate R

Launch an R console by clicking here: `R`

## Load Packages

The package we'll use to view the entire dataset with R is [`skimr`](https://docs.ropensci.org/skimr/). We will install and load the following packages:

```{r , eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "skimr"))
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
```


## Navigating Katacoda

Let's take a quick tour of our Katacoda environment. In the following steps, we'll be running code, viewing output, and creating graphs. To accomplish this, we'll need to understand what tools are at our disposal.

### Sidebar

You're reading this in the *Sidebar*. All of the instructions are in the Sidebar, and at the bottom, you'll find a "Continue" button to take you to the next step. See the image below:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/how-to-create-boxplots-in-r-with-ggplot2/img/sc-03-sidebar.png)


### Code Blocks

You will also find *code blocks* in the Sidebar. All the code blocks will run when you click on them (you've already run a few above!). See the following image for more examples:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/how-to-create-boxplots-in-r-with-ggplot2/img/sc-03-code-blocks.png)

<h3>Terminal</h3>

The *Terminal* is where the R code from each code block will run, along with any text *output*. We can also use R interactively by typing them directly into the Terminal after the *prompt* (`>`).

Go ahead and try it by typing (or copying and pasting) the following commands:

```{r}
tidyverse::tidyverse_logo()
```

You should see the following output in the Terminal:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/figs/sc-03-terminal-code.png)

### VS Code (Explorer)

When we create graphs, we will include the `ggplot2::ggsave()` function in the code block. This function allows us to save the graph image as a _.png_ file in the _VS Code explorer_.

### VS Code (ROOT)

Inside the VS Code explorer, you'll find a section labeled _ROOT_. _ROOT_ is a folder that contains our new graph files. We can open the _Graph file_ by clicking on them. See the following image for an example:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/how-to-create-boxplots-in-r-with-ggplot2/img/sc-03-explorer-root.png)

The following image gives you an overview of this entire process:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/how-to-create-boxplots-in-r-with-ggplot2/img/sc-03-code-run-png-view.png)

Now that we know how to navigate the Katacoda environment, we can start exploring data and building graphs!


# step2.md

## Load Ramen Data

The data we'll be using in this scenario comes from [the `TidyTuesday` project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), a data repository whose intent is "to provide a safe and supportive forum for individuals to practice their wrangling and data visualization skills independent of drawing conclusions."

We're going to use a dataset of ramen ratings from [The Ramen Rater](https://www.theramenrater.com/resources-2/the-list/). Read more about the data [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-06-04).

In the following, we import the raw data from an external .csv file into `Ramen` and get a `skimr::skim()` summary (stored in `RamenSkim`):

```{r}
Ramen <- readr::read_csv("https://bit.ly/38sO0S7")
RamenSkim <- skimr::skim(Ramen)
```

## Review Data

View the character variables in `RamenSkim`:

```{r}
RamenSkim %>%
  skimr::yank("character")
```

## How Complete Is the Data?

View the `mean`, standard deviation (`sd`), minimum (`p0`), median (`p50`), maximum (`p100`), and `hist` for the numeric variables in `Ramen`:

```{r}
RamenSkim %>%
  skimr::focus(numeric.mean, numeric.sd,
               numeric.p0, numeric.p50, numeric.p100,
               numeric.hist) %>%
  skimr::yank("numeric")
```

Pay attention to the `hist` column for `stars`&mdash;it shows the distribution for the values. *Where are most of the values concentrated?*

# step3.md

## Multiple Variable Distributions

We've looked at the distribution of all the values in the `stars` variable, but what if we were interested in the distribution of `stars` across the groups in another categorical variable, like `style`, which is the *style of container* (cup, pack, tray, etc.)?

We can check the levels of style with `dplyr::count()`:

```{r}
Ramen %>%
  count(style, sort = TRUE)
```

The output above tells us the top five most common reviews for ramen came from packs, bowls, cups, trays, and boxes.

## Grouped Skims

We can use `dplyr`, `filter`, `select`, and `group_by` functions with `skimr` to see the distribution of the `stars` variable across the five most common `style` levels:

```{r}
# click to execute code
Ramen %>%
  # filter to most common styles
  filter(style %in% c("Pack", "Bowl",
                      "Cup", "Tray", "Box")) %>%
  # select only stars and style
  select(stars, style) %>%
  # group dataset by style
  group_by(style) %>%
  # skim grouped data
  skim() %>%
  # focus on select output
  skimr::focus(n_missing, style,
               numeric.mean, numeric.sd, numeric.hist,
               numeric.p0, numeric.p50, numeric.p100) %>%
  # only return numeric values
  skimr::yank("numeric")
```

The output shows ramen from a `Box` has the highest `stars` rating. We are going to confirm this with a ridgeline plot.


# step4.md

## The ggridges Package

The mean and median (`p50`) in the skimr output tells us the distribution of `stars` varies slightly for the filtered levels of `style`, so we will view the density for each distribution with a ridgeline plot from the [`ggridges` package](https://wilkelab.org/ggridges/).

Install and load `ggridges` below:

```{r , eval=FALSE}
# click to execute code
install.packages("ggridges")
library(ggridges)
```

## Build Labels

We'll build the labels for this graph first in `labs_ridge_stars_style`, so we know what we're expecting to see:

```{r}
# click to execute code
labs_ridge_stars_style <- labs(
       title = "Star ratings by style",
       subtitle = "Star rating across most common ramen containers",
       caption = "source: https://www.theramenrater.com/resources-2/the-list/",
       x = "Star rating",
       y = NULL)
```

> *I've found this practice to be very helpful for conceptualizing graphs before I begin building them, which reduces errors and saves time!*


# step5.md

## Building Ridgeline Plots

The following code uses `ggridges::geom_density_ridges()` function to build overlapping density plots.

In this plot, we map the `fill` argument to the `style` variable. We also want to set the `show.legend = FALSE` to `FALSE` because we'll have labels on the graph for each level of `style`:

```{r}
# click to execute code
gg_step5_ridge_01 <- Ramen %>%
  # filter to most common styles
  filter(style %in% c("Pack", "Bowl",
                      "Cup", "Tray", "Box")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = stars,
             y = style,
             fill = style)) +
  geom_density_ridges(show.legend = FALSE) +
  # add labels
  labs_ridge_stars_style
# # save
# ggsave(plot = gg_step5_ridge_01,
#         filename = "gg-step5-ridge-01.png",
#         device = "png",
#         width = 9,
#         height = 6,
#         units = "in")
gg_step5_ridge_01
```

Open _gg-step5-ridge-01.png_ in the VS Code IDE above the Terminal console to view the graph.

We can see that the `stars` ratings for the `Box` level in `style` are concentrated around `5` from the ridgeline plot.
