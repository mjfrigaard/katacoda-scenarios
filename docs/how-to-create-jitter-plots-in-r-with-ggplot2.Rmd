# intro.md

## Welcome!

Welcome to "How to Create Jitter plots in R with ggplot2!" In this scenario, we will cover how to build a _jitter plot_ with a numeric and categorical variable.

This scenario assumes you've done some data wrangling with [`tidyr` and `dplyr`](https://learning.oreilly.com/scenarios/-/9781492079064), and [data visualization with `ggplot2`](https://learning.oreilly.com/scenarios/-/9781492079071).


## Knowing your Data

It's best to start a project off with a "view of the forest from outside the trees." The technical term for this is [data lineage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lineage#), which:

> "Includes the data origin, what happens to it, and where it moves over time."

Having a "bird's eye view" of the data ensures there weren't any problems with exporting or importing. Data lineage also means understanding where the data is coming from (e.g., a relational database, API, flat _.csv_ files, etc.).

## Tabular Data

Knowing some of the technical details behind a dataset lets us frame the questions or problems we're trying to tackle. In this scenario, we will use [tabular data](http://bit.ly/3aXXB4I) data (i.e., [spreadsheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet)). Tabular data organizes information into columns and rows.

Let's load some data and get started!


# step1.md

## Initiate R

Launch an R console by clicking here: `R`


## Load Packages

The package we'll use to view the entire dataset with R is [`skimr`](https://docs.ropensci.org/skimr/). We will install and load the following packages:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "skimr"))
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
```


## Navigating Katacoda

Let's take a quick tour of our Katacoda environment. In the following steps, we'll be running code, viewing output, and creating graphs. To accomplish this, we'll need to understand what tools are at our disposal.

### Sidebar

You're reading this in the *Sidebar*. All of the instructions are in the Sidebar, and at the bottom, you'll find a "Continue" button to take you to the next step. See the image below:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/how-to-create-boxplots-in-r-with-ggplot2/img/sc-03-sidebar.png)


### Code Blocks

You will also find *code blocks* in the Sidebar. All the code blocks will run when you click on them (you've already run a few above!). See the following image for more examples:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/how-to-create-boxplots-in-r-with-ggplot2/img/sc-03-code-blocks.png)

<h3>Terminal</h3>

The *Terminal* is where the R code from each code block will run, along with any text *output*. We can also use R interactively by typing them directly into the Terminal after the *prompt* (`>`).

Go ahead and try it by typing (or copying and pasting) the following commands:

```{r}
tidyverse::tidyverse_logo()
```

You should see the following output in the Terminal:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/figs/sc-03-terminal-code.png)

### VS Code (Explorer)

When we create graphs, we will include the `ggplot2::ggsave()` function in the code block. This function allows us to save the graph image as a _.png_ file in the _VS Code explorer_.

### VS Code (ROOT)

Inside the VS Code explorer, you'll find a section labeled _ROOT_. _ROOT_ is a folder that contains our new graph files. We can open the _Graph file_ by clicking on them. See the following image for an example:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/how-to-create-boxplots-in-r-with-ggplot2/img/sc-03-explorer-root.png)

The following image gives you an overview of this entire process:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/how-to-create-boxplots-in-r-with-ggplot2/img/sc-03-code-run-png-view.png)

Now that we know how to navigate the Katacoda environment, we can start exploring data and building graphs!


# step2.md

## Load IMDB Data

IMDB makes multiple datasets available for [download](https://datasets.imdbws.com/). We've combined the `title.ratings.tsv`, `name.basics.tsv`, and `title.principals.tsv` datasets into  the `ImdbData` dataset with the following columns:

* `tconst` = alphanumeric unique identifier of the title (used for joining)
* `nconst` = alphanumeric unique identifier of the name/person (used for joining)
* `category` = the category of job that person was in
* `primaryName` = name by which the person is most often credited
* `birthYear` = in `YYYY` format
* `averageRating` = weighted average of all the individual user ratings
* `numVotes` = number of votes the title has received
* `primaryTitle` = the more popular title/the title used by the filmmakers on promotional materials at the point of release
* `originalTitle` = original title, in the original language
* `isAdult` = `non-adult title` or `adult title`
* `startYear` = represents the release year of a title. In the case of TV Series, it is the series start year.
* `runtimeMinutes` = primary runtime of the title, in minutes
* `genres` = includes up to three genres associated with the title.
* `age_lead` = age of actor/actress at time of film (`age_lead = startYear - birthYear`)

```{r}
# click to execute code
ImdbData <- readr::read_csv("https://bit.ly/2O2ZKDC")
glimpse(ImdbData)
```

In the following, we build a `skimr::skim()` of the `ImdbData` dataset:

```{r}
# click to execute code
SkimImdbData <- skimr::skim(ImdbData)
summary(SkimImdbData)
```

First, we will review the character variables:

```{r}
# click to execute code
SkimImdbData %>%
  skimr::yank("character")
```


These all look complete.

## Do These Numbers Make Sense?

The number of individual responses (`n_unique`) for each character variable is a good source for sanity checks. For example, the largest number of unique values belongs to the title id variable (`tconst` = `136925`), and this is identical to the number of rows in the dataset. The next largest number belongs to the `originalTitle` variable (`128171`), and the documentation tells us this variable is the title for the film in its original language. By itself, this number doesn't tell us much, but we can see the next largest number (`124228`) is the film's `primaryTitle`, and it makes sense that the number of unique responses for these two variables is almost the same.

It also makes sense that the `n_unique` for actor/actress (`nconst`) is close to the actor/actress `primaryName`. There should be way more titles (`originalTitle` or `primaryTitle`) than `genres`, and there are (`1056`).

Finally, we can see the two binary variables we read about above (`category` and `isAdult`) only list `2` unique values (in `n_unique`), so it appears we imported these variables correctly.

Next, we will review the `mean`, standard deviation (`sd`), minimum (`p0`), median (`p50`), maximum (`p100`), and `hist` for the numeric variables in `ImdbData`:

```{r}
# click to execute code
SkimImdbData %>%
  skimr::focus(numeric.mean, numeric.sd,
               numeric.p0, numeric.p50, numeric.p100,
               numeric.hist) %>%
  skimr::yank("numeric")
```

## Do These Numbers Make Sense?

Let's take a look:

+ The average `birthYear` is `1947`, which is plausible considering the date range for movies in the IMDB (`1906` - `2021`).

+ The average movie rating is a `6.00`, which can be a little confusing considering [IMDB's rating scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb#User_ratings_of_films). Still, we can feel confident the data isn't skewed because the `mean` and median (`p50`) are relatively close to each other.

+ The number of votes (`numVotes`) is the most skewed variable because it ranges from `10` to `2334927`.

+ The `startYear` for the movie has an average of `1985`, and increases steadily from `1906` to `2021`, making sense because more films are being made every year.

+ The average length of each movie in `ImdbData` is `97.1` minutes (`runtimeMinutes`). But we can also see from the `hist` that the range for `runtimeMinutes` includes some very low and high values (`p0` = `2` and `p100` = `1500`).

The actor/actress's average age is `38.4`, with a low of `1` and a high of `98` (both plausible).

## Creating Categories from a Numerical Variable

We will proceed under the assumption that our stakeholders asked us to help explain the relationship between the average rating a movie received (`averageRating`) and the number of votes that went into the score (`numVotes`).

There are quite a few years in this dataset, so instead, we will split each measure into decades. To do this, we need a categorical variable from the `startYear` variable. The `cut()` function is handy because we can supply the number of `breaks` we want to split the numeric `startYear` variable into (`12` in this case). We will also create some clear labels for this categorical variable with the `labels` argument and make sure the format is `ordered`.

We check our new factor variable with the `fct_count()` from the `forcats` package:

```{r}
# click to execute code
ImdbData <- ImdbData %>%
  mutate(year_cat10 = cut(x = startYear,
                          breaks = 12,
                          labels = c("1910s", "1920s", "1930s",
                                     "1940s", "1950s", "1960s",
                                     "1970s", "1980s", "1990s",
                                     "2000s",  "2010s", "2020s"),
                          ordered = TRUE))
# check the count of our factor levels
fct_count(f = ImdbData$year_cat10, sort = TRUE)
```

# step3.md

## Scatterplots with geom_jitter

We want to examine how the `numVotes` variable changed over time (`year_cat10`). We want each decade on the `x` axis and the `numVotes` for each film on the `y`. Let's review the `numVotes` variable below with `skimr::skim()`:

```{r}
ImdbData$numVotes %>% skimr::skim()
```

We can see the values for this variable are concentrated, or skewed, towards `0`. However, we know enough information to build our labels:

```{r}
labs_numvotes_yearcat10 <- labs(
  title = "Number of IMDB review votes by decade",
  subtitle = "Internet Movie Database (IMDB)",
  caption = "https://www.imdb.com/",
  x = "Decade",
  y = "Number of votes")
```

We're going to view the distribution of `numVotes` across each decade in `year_cat10` with `ggplot2::geom_jitter()`. `geom_jitter()` geom is similar to `geom_point()`, except it adds "a small amount of random variation to the location of each point." We will set the following arguments inside the `geom_jitter()` to help demonstrate how it works:

+ `size = 0.9` = this controls how small/large the point will be
+ `width = 0.25` = determines how wide we want the points to 'jitter' (the default value is `.40`, so we're decreasing it slightly)
+ `alpha = 1/6` = the alpha controls the saturation (or transparency) of the points
+ `show.legend = FALSE` = remove the legend (it's labeled across the `x` axis)

```{r}
# # click to execute code
gg_step3_jitter_01 <- ImdbData %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year_cat10,
             y = numVotes,
             fill = year_cat10)) +
  geom_jitter(size = 0.9,
            width = 0.25,
            alpha = 1/6,
            show.legend = FALSE) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  # add labels
  labs_numvotes_yearcat10
# save
# ggsave(plot = gg_step3_jitter_01,
#         filename = "gg-step3-jitter-01.png",
#         device = "png",
#         width = 9,
#         height = 6,
#         units = "in")
gg_step3_jitter_01
```

Open _gg-step3-jitter-01.png_ in the VS Code IDE above the Terminal console to view the graph.

Notice how there are a handful of extreme points above `15000000`?


# step4.md

## Removing Extreme Values

Data with extreme values like this can be removed or transformed. If we have a reason to exclude this data, we can do `filter` the data to only the range we want in the graph (say `Number of votes < 1500000`), and then include this in the plot.

Run the following code to see what this would look like:

```{r}
# click to execute code
labs_jitter_numvote_yearcat10_02 <- labs(
  title = "Number of IMDB review votes by decade",
  subtitle = "Internet Movie Database (IMDB)",
  caption = "*Number of votes < 1500000; https://www.imdb.com",
  x = "Decade",
  y = "Number of votes")

gg_step4_jitter_02 <- ImdbData %>%
  filter(numVotes < 1500000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year_cat10,
             y = numVotes)) +
  geom_jitter(size = 0.9,
              width = 0.25,
              alpha = 1/6,
              show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs_jitter_numvote_yearcat10_02
# save
# ggsave(plot = gg_step4_jitter_02,
#         filename = "gg-step4-jitter-02.png",
#         device = "png",
#         width = 9,
#         height = 6,
#         units = "in")
gg_step4_jitter_02
```

Open _gg-step4-jitter-02.png_ in the VS Code IDE above the Terminal console to view the graph.

Now the extreme points above `15000000` have been removed.


# step5.md

## Axis Transformation

Another option is to transform the axis, which we can do with `ggplot2::scale_y_log10()`. This function changes the `y` axis scale using a base-10 log transformation.

We will also use the handy [`label_log10` function](https://bit.ly/35Ywt2q) developed by [Claus Wilke](https://wilkelab.org/):

```{r}
# click to execute code

#   load label_log10 function
source("https://bit.ly/35Ywt2q")

#  create new labels
labs_jitter_numvote_yearcat10_03 <- labs(
  title = "Number of IMDB review votes by decade",
  subtitle = "Internet Movie Database (IMDB)",
  caption = "*Number of votes log10 transformed; https://www.imdb.com",
  x = "Decade",
  y = "log10(Number of votes)")

#   create new graph
gg_step5_jitter_03 <- ImdbData %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year_cat10,
             y = numVotes)) +
  geom_jitter(size = 0.9,
              width = 0.25,
              alpha = 1/6,
              show.legend = FALSE) +
    scale_y_log10(labels = label_log10) +
  labs_jitter_numvote_yearcat10_03
#   save
# ggsave(plot = gg_step5_jitter_03,
#         filename = "gg-step5-jitter-03.png",
#         device = "png",
#         width = 9,
#         height = 6,
#         units = "in")
gg_step5_jitter_03
```

Open _gg-step5-jitter-03.png_ in the VS Code IDE above the Terminal console to view the graph.

We can see the `scale_y_log10()` transformation spreads the points out more uniformly across the `y` axis and makes it more challenging to interpret the number of votes.

Regardless of choice (removal of the extreme values or transforming the scale), we want to communicate these changes to our stakeholders. We also want to include them in any reports or write-ups to give them a distorted view of the underlying variable.
