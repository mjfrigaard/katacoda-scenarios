# intro.md

## Welcome!

Welcome to "How to Create Small Multiples in R with ggplot2!" In this scenario, we will cover how to arrange numerous figures together in a grid or facet.

This scenario assumes you've done some data wrangling with [`tidyr` and `dplyr`](https://learning.oreilly.com/scenarios/-/9781492079064), and [data visualization with `ggplot2`](https://learning.oreilly.com/scenarios/-/9781492079071).

## Knowing your Data

It's best to start a project off with a "view of the forest from outside the trees." The technical term for this is [data lineage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lineage#), which:

> "Includes the data origin, what happens to it, and where it moves over time."

Having a "bird's eye view" of the data ensures there weren't any problems with exporting or importing. Data lineage also means understanding where the data is coming from (e.g., a relational database, API, flat _.csv_ files, etc.).

## Tabular Data

Knowing some of the technical details behind a dataset lets us frame the questions or problems we're trying to tackle. In this scenario, we will use [tabular data](http://bit.ly/3aXXB4I) data (i.e., [spreadsheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet)). Tabular data organizes information into columns and rows.

Let's load some data and get started!


# step1.md

## Initiate R

Launch an R console by clicking here: `R`

## Load packages

The package we'll use to view the entire dataset with R is [`skimr`](https://docs.ropensci.org/skimr/). We will install and load the following packages:

```{r , eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "skimr"))
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
```


## Navigating Katacoda

Let's take a quick tour of our Katacoda environment. In the following steps, we'll be running code, viewing output, and creating graphs. To accomplish this, we'll need to understand what tools are at our disposal.

### Sidebar

You're reading this in the *Sidebar*. All of the instructions are in the Sidebar, and at the bottom, you'll find a "Continue" button to take you to the next step. See the image below:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/how-to-create-boxplots-in-r-with-ggplot2/img/sc-03-sidebar.png)


### Code Blocks

You will also find *code blocks* in the Sidebar. All the code blocks will run when you click on them (you've already run a few above!). See the following image for more examples:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/how-to-create-boxplots-in-r-with-ggplot2/img/sc-03-code-blocks.png)

### Terminal

The *Terminal* is where the R code from each code block will run, along with any text *output*. We can also use R interactively by typing them directly into the Terminal after the *prompt* (`>`).

Go ahead and try it by typing (or copying and pasting) the following commands:

```{r}
tidyverse::tidyverse_logo()
```

You should see the following output in the Terminal:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/figs/sc-03-terminal-code.png)

### VS Code (Explorer)

When we create graphs, we will include the `ggplot2::ggsave()` function in the code block. This function allows us to save the graph image as a _.png_ file in the _VS Code explorer_.

### VS Code (ROOT)

Inside the VS Code explorer, you'll find a section labeled _ROOT_. _ROOT_ is a folder that contains our new graph files. We can open the _Graph file_ by clicking on them. See the following image for an example:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/how-to-create-boxplots-in-r-with-ggplot2/img/sc-03-explorer-root.png)

The following image gives you an overview of this entire process:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/how-to-create-boxplots-in-r-with-ggplot2/img/sc-03-code-run-png-view.png)

Now that we know how to navigate the Katacoda environment, we can start exploring data and building graphs!


# step2.md

## Multiple Graph Displays

Sometimes data is so complex and layered that it requires multiple graphs. In this case, we will want to arrange numerous figures together in a grid or facet. Charts presented this way are called "[small multiples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_multiple)," a term popularized by [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/):

> "Small multiples resemble the frames of a movie: a series of graphics, showing the same combination of variables, indexed by changes in another variable." Edward Tufte, [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi).

We are going to demonstrate faceting with a dataset we've created from the [Internet Movie Database (IMDB)](https://www.imdb.com/).

## IMDB Data

IMDB makes multiple datasets available for [download](https://datasets.imdbws.com/). We've combined the `title.ratings.tsv`, `name.basics.tsv`, and `title.principals.tsv` datasets into  the `ImdbData` dataset with the following columns:

* `tconst` = alphanumeric unique identifier of the title (used for joining)
* `nconst` = alphanumeric unique identifier of the name/person (used for joining)
* `category` = the category of job that person was in
* `primaryName` = name by which the person is most often credited
* `birthYear` = in `YYYY` format
* `averageRating` = weighted average of all the individual user ratings
* `numVotes` = number of votes the title has received
* `primaryTitle` = the more popular title/the title used by the filmmakers on promotional materials at the point of release
* `originalTitle` = original title, in the original language
* `isAdult` = `non-adult title` or `adult title`
* `startYear` = represents the release year of a title. In the case of TV Series, it is the series start year.
* `runtimeMinutes` = primary runtime of the title, in minutes
* `genres` = includes up to three genres associated with the title.
* `age_lead` = age of actor/actress at time of film (`age_lead = startYear - birthYear`)

```{r}
# click to execute code
ImdbData <- readr::read_csv("https://bit.ly/2O2ZKDC")
glimpse(ImdbData)
```

In the following, we build a `skimr::skim()` of the `ImdbData` dataset:

```{r}
# click to execute code
SkimImdbData <- skimr::skim(ImdbData)
summary(SkimImdbData)
```

First, we will review the character variables.

```{r}
# click to execute code
SkimImdbData %>%
  skimr::yank("character")
```


These all look complete.

## Do These Numbers Make Sense?

The number of individual responses (`n_unique`) for each character variable is a good source for sanity checks. For example, the largest number of unique values belongs to the title id variable (`tconst` = `136925`), and this is identical to the number of rows in the dataset. The next largest number belongs to the `originalTitle` variable (`128171`), and the documentation tells us this variable is the title for the film in its original language. By itself, this number doesn't tell us much, but we can see the next largest number (`124228`) is the film's `primaryTitle`, and it makes sense that the number of unique responses for these two variables is almost the same.

It also makes sense that the `n_unique` for actor/actress (`nconst`) is close to the actor/actress `primaryName`. There should be way more titles (`originalTitle` or `primaryTitle`) than `genres`, and there are (`1056`).

Finally, we can see the two binary variables we read about above (`category` and `isAdult`) only list `2` unique values (in `n_unique`), so it appears we imported these variables correctly.

Next, we will review the `mean`, standard deviation (`sd`), minimum (`p0`), median (`p50`), maximum (`p100`), and `hist` for the numeric variables in `ImdbData`:

```{r}
# click to execute code
SkimImdbData %>%
  skimr::focus(numeric.mean, numeric.sd,
               numeric.p0, numeric.p50, numeric.p100,
               numeric.hist) %>%
  skimr::yank("numeric")
```

## Do These Numbers Make Sense?

Let's take a look:

+ The average `birthYear` is `1947`, which is plausible considering the date range for movies in the IMDB (`1906` - `2021`).

+ The average movie rating is a `6.00`, which can be a little confusing considering [IMDB's rating scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb#User_ratings_of_films). Still, we can feel confident the data isn't skewed because the `mean` and median (`p50`) are relatively close to each other.

+ The number of votes (`numVotes`) is the most skewed variable because it ranges from `10` to `2334927`.

+ The `startYear` for the movie has an average of `1985`, and increases steadily from `1906` to `2021`, making sense because more films are being made every year.

+ The average length of each movie in `ImdbData` is `97.1` minutes (`runtimeMinutes`). But we can also see from the `hist` that the range for `runtimeMinutes` includes some very low and high values (`p0` = `2` and `p100` = `1500`).

The actor/actress's average age is `38.4`, with a low of `1` and a high of `98` (both plausible).


# step3.md

## Creating Year Categories

We will proceed under the assumption that our stakeholders asked us to help explain the relationship between the average rating a movie received (`averageRating`) and the number of votes that went into the score (`numVotes`).

There are quite a few years in this dataset, so instead, we will split each measure into decades. To do this, we need a categorical variable from the `startYear` variable. The `cut()` function is handy because we can supply the number of `breaks` we want to split the numeric `startYear` variable into (`12` in this case). We will also create some clear labels for this categorical variable with the `labels` argument and make sure the format is `ordered`.

We check our new factor variable with the `fct_count()` from the `forcats` package:

```{r}
# click to execute code
ImdbData <- ImdbData %>%
  mutate(year_cat10 = cut(x = startYear,
                          breaks = 12,
                          labels = c("1910s", "1920s", "1930s",
                                     "1940s", "1950s", "1960s",
                                     "1970s", "1980s", "1990s",
                                     "2000s",  "2010s", "2020s"),
                          ordered = TRUE))
# check the count of our factor levels
fct_count(f = ImdbData$year_cat10, sort = TRUE)
```

## Number of Votes

We want to examine how the `numVotes` variable changed over time (`year_cat10`). Let's review the `numVotes` variable below with `skimr::skim()`:

```{r}
ImdbData$numVotes %>% skimr::skim()
```

We can see the values for this variable are concentrated, or skewed, towards `0`.

## Average Individual User Ratings

The `averageRating` gives us the weighted average of all the individual user ratings. We will refresh our memory about this variable by taking a quick look at the `skimr::skim()` output below:

```{r}
ImdbData$averageRating %>%
  skimr::skim()
```

We want each decade on the `x` axis and the `numVotes` for each film on the `y`.

The distribution for `averageRating` looks evenly distributed around the mean and median, and the `hist` looks relatively symmetrical. We will see if this holds for `averageRating` when we look at it across the levels of `year_cat10`.


# step4.md

## Summary of Votes by Year Categories

Below is the `mean`, standard deviation (`sd`), minimum (`p0`), 25th percentile (`p25`), median (`p50`), 75th percentile (`p75`), maximum (`p100`), and `hist` for the `numVotes`, grouped by `year_cat10`:

```{r}
# click to execute code
ImdbData %>%
  group_by(year_cat10) %>%
  select(year_cat10, numVotes) %>%
  skimr::skim() %>%
  skimr::focus(numeric.mean, numeric.sd,
               numeric.p0, numeric.p50, numeric.p100,
               numeric.hist)
```

## Summary of Average Individual User Ratings by Year Categories

Below is the `mean`, standard deviation (`sd`), minimum (`p0`), 25th percentile (`p25`), median (`p50`), 75th percentile (`p75`), maximum (`p100`), and `hist` for the `averageRating`, grouped by `year_cat10`:

```{r}
# click to execute code
ImdbData %>%
  group_by(year_cat10) %>%
  select(year_cat10, averageRating) %>%
  skimr::skim() %>%
  skimr::focus(numeric.mean, numeric.sd,
               numeric.p0, numeric.p50, numeric.p100,
               numeric.hist)
```

How do you think the relationship between `numVotes` and `averageRating` will look?

## Faceting for Multiple Comparisons

We want to make direct comparisons across time by placing an individual plot for each decade within the same view. The best way to accomplish this is by using small multiples, where we repeat the same graph for each snapshot of time and present them in a grid.

The functions for creating small multiples in `ggplot2` are `facet_wrap()` or `facet_grid()`. We will demonstrate this below using the former, and we also make some adjustments to the `x` axis to make it easier to read:

Inside the `ggplot2::scale_x_continuous()` function:

+ Set `limits` to `10` (the minimum) and `2334927` (the maximum)
+ The `breaks` argument specifies how we want to 'break up' our `x` axis. We will use the minimum, `1167464` (which is 0.5 x the maximum), and the maximum
+ `labels` specifies what text we want to display at each `break`

The `ggplot2::facet_wrap()` function uses a `~` followed by the categorical variable (`year_cat10`) we've specified in the `ggplot(aes(group = ))` argument.

Now we can build our labels and small multiples graph:

```{R}
# click to execute code

#   build labels
labs_avgusr_nmvote_yearcat10 <- labs(
  title = "Number of votes vs average individual user ratings over time",
  subtitle = "Internet Movie Database (IMDB)",
  caption = "https://www.imdb.com",
  y = "Average individual user ratings",
  x = "Number of votes")


gg_step4_facet_01 <- ImdbData %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = numVotes,
             y = averageRating,
             group = year_cat10)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5,
              alpha = 1/10,
              show.legend = FALSE) +
  # add x scale attributes
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(10, 2334927),
                     breaks = c(10, 1167464, 2334927),
                     labels = c('10', '~1.2M', '~2.3M')) +
  # add facet
    facet_wrap(~ year_cat10) +
    labs_avgusr_nmvote_yearcat10

# save
# ggsave(plot = gg_step4_facet_01,
#         filename = "gg-step4-facet-01.png",
#         device = "png",
#         width = 9,
#         height = 6,
#         units = "in")
gg_step4_facet_01
```

Open _gg-step4-facet-01.png_ in the VS Code IDE above the Terminal console to view the graph.

We can see how small multiples allow for more incisive comparisons. The relationship between votes and average user rating becomes slightly evident as time progresses. A few data points approach the `8.75` line in 1960 and 1970, and there appears to be a slight upward trend for average user rating from 1990-2020.


# step5.md

## Transforming Axes

We will use small multiples again, but this time we will view a log10 transformed `numVotes` variable. Transforming an axis can sometimes make the display easier to see, but we also need to find a way to explain this change to our audience.

We will need to update our labels, add the `scale_x_log10()` layer, and use `facet_wrap()` with `year_cat10`. We will also use the handy [`label_log10` function](https://bit.ly/35Ywt2q) developed by [Claus Wilke](https://wilkelab.org/):

```{r}
# click to execute code

# build labels
labs_avgusr_lognmvote_yearcat10 <- labs(
  title = "*Number of votes vs average individual user ratings over time",
  subtitle = "Internet Movie Database (https://www.imdb.com/)",
  caption = "*Number of votes is has been log10 transformed",
  y = "Average individual user ratings",
  x = "log10(Number of votes)")

# load label_log10 function
source("https://bit.ly/35Ywt2q")

# build plot
gg_step5_facet_02 <- ImdbData %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = numVotes,
             y = averageRating,
             group = year_cat10)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5,
             alpha = 1/10,
             show.legend = FALSE) +
  # add log10 x axis
    scale_x_log10(labels = label_log10) +
  # facet wrap on decades
    facet_wrap(~ year_cat10) +
  # add labels
  labs_avgusr_lognmvote_yearcat10

# save
# ggsave(plot = gg_step5_facet_02,
#         filename = "gg-step5-facet-02.png",
#         device = "png",
#         width = 9,
#         height = 6,
#         units = "in")
gg_step5_facet_02
```

Open _gg-step5-facet-02.png_ in the VS Code IDE above the Terminal console to view the graph.

Now the small multiples show the relationship between the log10 transformed number of votes and average user rating. The majority of the data points appear concentrated around the same value for average user rating (~6.125).

## Adding A Best Fit Line

We can use `ggplot2`'s `geom_smooth()` function to draw a smoothed 'best-fit line' through the data points in each decade. Modeling is beyond the scope of this scenario, but feel free to read more about building models in this chapter of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-intro.html).

For now, know the following:

+ `method = 'lm'` tells geom_smooth to fit the best straight line through the data points
+ `size = 0.75` is the size of the line
+ `color = "firebrick2"` will make the line color red
+ `fullrange = TRUE` will draw the line through the entire range of the graph

```{r}
# click to execute code

#   build labels
labs_avgusr_lognmvote_yearcat10_lm <- labs(
  title = "*Number of votes vs average individual user ratings over time",
  subtitle = "Internet Movie Database (https://www.imdb.com/)",
  caption = "*Number of votes is has been log10 transformed; lm smooth line",
  y = "Average individual user ratings",
  x = "log10(Number of votes)")

gg_step5_facet_03 <- ImdbData %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = numVotes,
             y = averageRating,
             geoup = year_cat10)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5,
              alpha = 1/10,
              show.legend = FALSE) +
  # add smoothed line
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm',
              size = 0.75,
              color = "firebrick2",
              fullrange = TRUE) +
  # add x axis attributes
    scale_x_log10(labels = label_log10) +
  # add facets
    facet_wrap(~ year_cat10)

# save
# ggsave(plot = gg_step5_facet_03,
#        filename = "gg-step5-facet-03.png",
#         device = "png",
#         width = 9,
#         height = 6,
#         units = "in")
gg_step5_facet_03
```

Open _gg-step5-facet-03.png_ in the VS Code IDE above the Terminal console to view the graph.

We can see the relationship for the log10 transformed number of votes versus average user rating is slightly positive but has become less pronounced over time. The gray band is the standard error associated with the red smoothed line we've drawn (fewer data points = more error).
