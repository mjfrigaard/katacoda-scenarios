# intro.md

## Welcome!

Welcome to "How to Create Scatterplots in R with ggplot2!" In this scenario, we will cover how to build a _scatter plots_ between two numeric variables.

This scenario assumes you've done some data wrangling with [`tidyr` and `dplyr`](https://learning.oreilly.com/scenarios/-/9781492079064), and [data visualization with `ggplot2`](https://learning.oreilly.com/scenarios/-/9781492079071).

## Knowing your Data

It's best to start a project off with a "view of the forest from outside the trees." The technical term for this is [data lineage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lineage#), which:

> "Includes the data origin, what happens to it, and where it moves over time."

Having a "bird's eye view" of the data ensures there weren't any problems with exporting or importing. Data lineage also means understanding where the data is coming from (e.g., a relational database, API, flat _.csv_ files, etc.).

## Tabular Data

Knowing some of the technical details behind a dataset lets us frame the questions or problems we're trying to tackle. In this scenario, we will use [tabular data](http://bit.ly/3aXXB4I) data (i.e., [spreadsheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet)). Tabular data organizes information into columns and rows.

Let's load some data and get started!


# step1.md

## Initiate R

Launch an R console by clicking here: `R`{{execute}}.


## Load Packages

The package we'll use to view the entire dataset with R is [`skimr`](https://docs.ropensci.org/skimr/). We will install and load the following packages:


```{r , eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "skimr"))
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
```


## Navigating Katacoda

Let's take a quick tour of our Katacoda environment. In the following steps, we'll be running code, viewing output, and creating graphs. To accomplish this, we'll need to understand what tools are at our disposal.

### Sidebar

You're reading this in the *Sidebar*. All of the instructions are in the Sidebar, and at the bottom, you'll find a "Continue" button to take you to the next step. See the image below:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/how-to-create-boxplots-in-r-with-ggplot2/img/sc-03-sidebar.png)


### Code Blocks

You will also find *code blocks* in the Sidebar. All the code blocks will run when you click on them (you've already run a few above!). See the following image for more examples:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/how-to-create-boxplots-in-r-with-ggplot2/img/sc-03-code-blocks.png)

### Terminal

The *Terminal* is where the R code from each code block will run, along with any text *output*. We can also use R interactively by typing them directly into the Terminal after the *prompt* (`>`).

Go ahead and try it by typing (or copying and pasting) the following commands:

```{r}
tidyverse::tidyverse_logo()
```

You should see the following output in the Terminal:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/figs/sc-03-terminal-code.png)

### VS Code (Explorer)

When we create graphs, we will include the `ggplot2::ggsave()` function in the code block. This function allows us to save the graph image as a _.png_ file in the _VS Code explorer_.

### VS Code (ROOT)

Inside the VS Code explorer, you'll find a section labeled _ROOT_. _ROOT_ is a folder that contains our new graph files. We can open the _Graph file_ by clicking on them. See the following image for an example:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/how-to-create-boxplots-in-r-with-ggplot2/img/sc-03-explorer-root.png)

The following image gives you an overview of this entire process:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/how-to-create-boxplots-in-r-with-ggplot2/img/sc-03-code-run-png-view.png)

Now that we know how to navigate the Katacoda environment, we can start exploring data and building graphs!


# step2.md

## Displaying Relationships

In this scenario, we will look at how two numeric variables change (or vary) and if that change is in the same (or opposite) direction. One of the most common graphs for visualizing this relationship between two numerical variables is the [_scatterplot_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatter_plot). A scatterplot uses points to display two numeric variables, with one variable on each axis.

## Star Wars Data

We will load the `starwars` data from the `dplyr` package. This data comes from the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/). Read more about this dataset on [`dplyr`s website](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/starwars.html):

```{r}
# click to execute code
StarWars <- dplyr::starwars
```

We will look at the relationship between `height` and `mass` for characters in the `StarWars` dataset. Let's start by looking at the `n_missing` and `complete_rate` for these two variables:

```{r}
# click to execute code
StarWars %>%
  select(height, mass) %>%
  skimr::skim() %>%
  skimr::focus(n_missing, complete_rate) %>%
  skimr::yank("numeric")
```


We can see that almost two-thirds of the data in `mass` are missing. This amount of missing data might surprise us if we didn't explore it before plotting.

We will also view the `mean`, standard deviation (`sd`), minimum (`p0`), 25th percentile (`p25`), median (`p50`), 75th percentile (`p75`), maximum (`p100`), and `hist` for these two columns:

```{r}
# click to execute code
StarWars %>%
  select(height, mass) %>%
  skimr::skim() %>%
    skimr::focus(numeric.mean, numeric.sd,
                 numeric.p0, numeric.p25,
                 numeric.p50, numeric.p75,
                 numeric.p100, numeric.hist) %>%
  skimr::yank("numeric")
```

We can see at least one value of `mass` that is considerably higher than the rest. We can tell because the location statistics are similar to each other (`mean` = `97.3`, median (`p50`) = `84.5`), but the spread is almost twice the value of the location (`sd` = `169`). The maximum value (`p100`) of `1358` also confirms this finding. *What is going on with this value?*


# step3.md

## Investigating Outliers

It's always a good idea to investigate values that seem implausible. Outliers can have a big impact on data visualizations (and statistical models), so ensuring we account for them is essential for communicating with our audience.

We're going to `filter` the `StarWars` data only observations with `mass` more than `180`, and `select` only the `name`, `height`, `mass`, `sex`, and `species` columns (we chose `200` because it's approximately 2x the `p75` value):

```{r}
StarWars %>%
    filter(mass > 200) %>%
    select(name, height, mass, sex, species)
```

We can now see this `mass` belongs to Jabba the Hutt, which makes sense if we do some [additional research](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jabba_Desilijic_Tiure).

## Build Labels

Now that we know what we're going to visualize, we can make our labels:

```{r}
# click to execute code
labs_scatter_ht_mass_01 <- labs(
  title = "Star Wars Character's height and mass",
  x = "Mass",
  y = "Height")
```


# step4.md

## Scatterplots

We will create a scatterplot with `ggplot2::geom_point()` by mapping `mass` to the `x` axis and map `height` to the `y` axis:

```{r}
# click to execute code
gg_step4_scatter_01 <- StarWars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mass, y = height)) +
  geom_point() +
  # add labels
  labs_scatter_ht_mass_01
# save
# ggsave(plot = gg_step4_scatter_01,
#         filename = "gg-step4-scatter-01.png",
#         device = "png",
#         width = 9,
#         height = 6,
#         units = "in")
gg_step4_scatter_01
```

Open _gg-step4-scatter-01.png_ in the VS Code IDE above the Terminal console to view the graph.

Notice how the points are all clustered on the left-hand side of the chart? The `x` axis has extended to account for Jabba the Hutt's high `mass` value, which has made it hard to interpret the relationship among the other values.

*What happens when we remove the outliers?*

## Removing Outliers

If you encounter outliers, it's a good idea to view each graph with and without them to see how much they influence the plot. Let's `filter` Jabba the Hutt's `mass` out of the `Starwars` dataset and rebuild the scatterplot. We'll also add this information to a new set of labels, so we don't get the two graphs confused:

```{r}
# click to execute code

# new labels
labs_scatter_ht_mass_02 <- labs(
  title = "Star Wars Character's height and mass",
  subtitle = "Characters with mass less than 200",
  x = "Mass",
  y = "Height")

# build graph
gg_step4_scatter_02 <- StarWars %>%
  filter(mass < 200) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mass, y = height)) +
  geom_point() +
  # add labels
  labs_scatter_ht_mass_02
# save
# ggsave(plot = gg_step4_scatter_02,
#         filename = "gg-step4-scatter-02.png",
#         device = "png",
#         width = 9,
#         height = 6,
#         units = "in")
gg_step4_scatter_02
```

Open _gg-step4-scatter-02.png_ in the VS Code IDE above the Terminal console to view the graph.

Based on the scatterplot, we can see a positive relationship between `mass` and `height` for Star Wars characters. But is this the same for all types of characters? For example, does this relationship hold for all kinds of `gender`?



# step5.md

## Counting with tabyls

We will continue looking at the relationship between `mass` and `height` in the `Starwars` dataset. We looked at `mass` and `height` with and without an outlier's influence in the previous step. In this step, we will add a categorical variable (`gender`) to the plot to see if the direction of the change for `mass` and `height` is the same for all kinds of `gender`.

Let's view the count of gender below using the `tabyl()` function from the [`janitor` package](https://sfirke.github.io/janitor/):

```{r , eval=FALSE}
# click to execute code
install.packages("janitor")
library(janitor)
```

`janitor::tabyl()` works similar to `dplyr::count()`, but automatically prints a bit more information in the output. Click on the code block below to create a `tably` for the `gender` variable:

```{r}
# click to execute code
StarWars %>%
  janitor::tabyl(gender)
```

We can see the standard output produces a `percent` and `valid_percent` columns. We can also add percent formatting with `janitor::adorn_pct_formatting()`:

```{r}
# click to execute code
StarWars %>%
  janitor::tabyl(gender) %>%
  janitor::adorn_pct_formatting()
```

This output tells us `4` characters in the `StarWars` dataset will not show up if we use the `gender` variable. Read more about the `tabyl` function options [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/janitor/vignettes/tabyls.html).

## Scatterplot (Three Variables)

One way to include the `gender` variable in the scatterplot is to map it to the `color` aesthetic. The output from `tabyl` tells us there are `4` values in `gender` that will be missing from this plot.

We will update our labels and add `gender` to the scatterplot in the following:

```{r}
# click to execute code
labs_scatter_ht_mass_gender <- labs(
  title = "Star Wars Character's gender, height and mass",
  subtitle = "Data for gender (feminine/masculine), height, and mass < 200",
  x = "Mass",
  color = "Gender",
  y = "Height")

gg_step5_scatter_03 <- StarWars %>%
  filter(!is.na(gender) & mass < 200) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mass, y = height, color = gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  # add labels
  labs_scatter_ht_mass_02
# save
# ggsave(plot = gg_step5_scatter_03,
#         filename = "gg-step5-scatter-03.png",
#         device = "png",
#         width = 9,
#         height = 6,
#         units = "in")
gg_step5_scatter_03
```

Open _gg-step5-scatter-03.png_ in the VS Code IDE above the Terminal console to view the graph.

The color of the points shows that the `feminine` characters occupy a smaller range of values for the relationship between `mass` and `height`.
