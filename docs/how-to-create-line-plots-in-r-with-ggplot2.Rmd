# intro.md

## Welcome!

Welcome to "How to Create Line Plots in R with ggplot2!" In this scenario, we will cover how to build *line plots* for time-dependent data.

This scenario assumes you've done some data wrangling with [`tidyr` and `dplyr`](https://learning.oreilly.com/scenarios/-/9781492079064), and [data visualization with `ggplot2`](https://learning.oreilly.com/scenarios/-/9781492079071).

## Knowing your Data

It's best to start a project off with a "view of the forest from outside the trees." The technical term for this is [data lineage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lineage#), which:

> "Includes the data origin, what happens to it, and where it moves over time."

Having a "bird's eye view" of the data ensures there weren't any problems with exporting or importing. Data lineage also means understanding where the data is coming from (e.g., a relational database, API, flat _.csv_ files, etc.).

## Tabular Data

Knowing some of the technical details behind a dataset lets us frame the questions or problems we're trying to tackle. In this scenario, we will use [tabular data](http://bit.ly/3aXXB4I) data (i.e., [spreadsheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet)). Tabular data organizes information into columns and rows.

Let's load some data and get started!


# step1.md

## Initiate R

Launch an R console by clicking here: `R`


### Load packages

The package we'll use to view the entire dataset with R is [`skimr`](https://docs.ropensci.org/skimr/). We will install and load the following packages:


```{r , eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "skimr"))
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
```


## Navigating Katacoda

Let's take a quick tour of our Katacoda environment. In the following steps, we'll be running code, viewing output, and creating graphs. To accomplish this, we'll need to understand what tools are at our disposal.

### Sidebar

You're reading this in the *Sidebar*. All of the instructions are in the Sidebar, and at the bottom, you'll find a "Continue" button to take you to the next step. See the image below:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/how-to-create-boxplots-in-r-with-ggplot2/img/sc-03-sidebar.png)


### Code Blocks

You will also find *code blocks* in the Sidebar. All the code blocks will run when you click on them (you've already run a few above!). See the following image for more examples:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/how-to-create-boxplots-in-r-with-ggplot2/img/sc-03-code-blocks.png)

<h3>Terminal</h3>

The *Terminal* is where the R code from each code block will run, along with any text *output*. We can also use R interactively by typing them directly into the Terminal after the *prompt* (`>`).

Go ahead and try it by typing (or copying and pasting) the following commands:

```{r}
tidyverse::tidyverse_logo()
```

You should see the following output in the Terminal:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/figs/sc-03-terminal-code.png)

### VS Code (Explorer)

When we create graphs, we will include the `ggplot2::ggsave()` function in the code block. This function allows us to save the graph image as a _.png_ file in the _VS Code explorer_.

### VS Code (ROOT)

Inside the VS Code explorer, you'll find a section labeled _ROOT_. _ROOT_ is a folder that contains our new graph files. We can open the _Graph file_ by clicking on them. See the following image for an example:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/how-to-create-boxplots-in-r-with-ggplot2/img/sc-03-explorer-root.png)

The following image gives you an overview of this entire process:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/how-to-create-boxplots-in-r-with-ggplot2/img/sc-03-code-run-png-view.png)

Now that we know how to navigate the Katacoda environment, we can start exploring data and building graphs!


# step2.md

## Comic Book Data

When we want to look at how a particular measurement changes over time (also known as a trendline), we use the `x` axis to display the measure of time (days, weeks, months, etc.), and the `y` axis contains our measurement of interest.

Each time point along the `x` axis has a corresponding value on the `y` axis, and we use lines connect these points. These lines then extend along the `x` axis's full scale to display the change over time (or the *trend*). See the example from the FiveThirtyEight article titled, ["Comic Books Are Still Made By Men, For Men And About Men"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/women-in-comic-books/):

![](https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/hickey-feature-comics-3.png?w=1220)

We're going to re-create this chart using data from the `fivethirtyeightdata` package. The [`fivethirtyeightdata` package](https://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.app/) contains data from the [FiveThirtyEight Github repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data), but the data has been formatted to provide "tame data principles for introductory statistics and data science courses."

We are going to load the `comic_characters` dataset from the article above. We're only interested in a subset of this dataset, so we select the relevant variables and do some initial formatting steps before assigning them to the `ComicData` (read more about the data [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fivethirtyeight/vignettes/fivethirtyeight.html)):

```{r}
# click to execute code
ComicData <- read_csv("https://bit.ly/2QJARxG")
```

```{r}
# click to execute code

# subset data
ComicData <- ComicData %>%
  # select only publisher, name, sex, year,
  # and date
  select(publisher, name, sex, year, date) %>%
  # filter to only the rows containing either
  # male or female characters
  filter(sex %in% c("Female Characters",
                    "Male Characters")) %>%
  # convert these two variables to factors
  mutate(sex = factor(sex,
                      levels = c("Female Characters",
                                 "Male Characters")),
         publisher = factor(publisher,
                            levels = c("Marvel", "DC"))) %>%
  # remove all missing values
  drop_na()
# view
glimpse(ComicData)
```

We formatted two variables in `ComicData` as `factor`s. We will use `skimr::skim()` to get an overview of `publisher` and `sex`.

## Factors

Factor variables are unique kinds of qualitative or categorical variables in R because they have a ["fixed and known set of possible values."](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html). We assigned these values with the `levels` argument.

The `skimr` output below shows us the two new factor variables we've created in `ComicNewFemalePerc`:

```{r}
# click to execute code
ComicData %>%
  skimr::skim() %>%
  skimr::yank("factor")
```

The `top_counts` column tells us the counts for both levels in `publisher` and `sex`.

## Summarizing Data

To recreate the graph above, we'll need to summarize the `ComicData` data. We need `year` represented on the `x` axis, and the percentage of female comic book characters for each `publisher` represented on the `y` axis. We can do this with `dplyr`s `group_by()`, `summarize()`, `mutate()`, and `ungroup()` functions.

The following code creates two new variables:

- `sex_n_per_yr_pub`, which is the count of each level of `sex` per year and `publisher`
- `sex_pct_per_yr_pub`, which is the percentage of each level of sex per `year` and `publisher`

We also filter the `year` variable to only data between `1980` and `2010`:

```{r}
# click to execute code
ComicNewFemalePerc <- ComicData %>%
  group_by(year, publisher, sex) %>%
  summarize(sex_n_per_yr_pub = sum(n())) %>%
  group_by(year, publisher) %>%
  mutate(sex_pct_per_yr_pub = sex_n_per_yr_pub / sum(sex_n_per_yr_pub),
         sex_pct_per_yr_pub = round(sex_pct_per_yr_pub, digits = 3)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(year > 1979 & year < 2011)
head(ComicNewFemalePerc)
```

View the `ComicNewFemalePerc` data in the Terminal by executing the code below:

```{r}
# click to execute code
glimpse(ComicNewFemalePerc)
```


# step3.md

## Visualizing Relationships Over Time

We will build labels identical to those in the FiveThirtyEight graph but include the original article's URL as a `caption`:

```{r}
# click to execute code
labs_line_comics <- labs(
  title = "Comics Aren't Gaining Many Female Characters",
  subtitle = "Percentage of new characters who are female",
  caption = "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/women-in-comic-books/",
  x = NULL,
  y = NULL)
```

Now that we have our data and labels, we can build the line graph. First, we need to `filter` the data to only female percentages, then pass the filtered data to `ggplot(aes())`, mapping the `year` to the `x` axis and `sex_pct_per_yr_pub` to the `y` axis.

On the next layer, inside the `ggplot2::geom_line()` function, we map `publisher` to the `group` and `color` aesthetics inside the `aes()` function. Outside the `aes()` function, we make the lines larger by setting the `size` to `2`.

We need to make a few more customizations to this graph to make it look like the one in the article.

The FiveThirtyEight graph does not have a legend or guide. We can remove the legend by adding a `ggplot2::theme(legend.position = "none")` layer.

The `y` axis in the FiveThirtyEight graph ranges from `0` to `50` and is formatted as a percent (`%`). Displaying percentage units helps the audience understand that a proportion is displayed (not the raw counts). We can change the formatting on the `y` axis with the `ggplot2::scale_y_continuous()` function. Set the `limits` argument to `c(0.00, 0.50))`, and the `labels` argument to `scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)`.

```{r}
# click to execute code
gg_step3_line_01 <- ComicNewFemalePerc %>%
  filter(sex == "Female Characters") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = sex_pct_per_yr_pub)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = publisher, color = publisher),
            size = 2) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.00, 0.50),
         labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  # add labels
  labs_line_comics
# save
# ggsave(plot = gg_step3_line_01,
#         filename = "gg-step3-line-01.png",
#         device = "png",
#         width = 9,
#         height = 6,
#         units = "in")
gg_step3_line_01
```

Open _gg-step3-line-01.png_ in the VS Code IDE above the Terminal console to view the graph.

Our graph is starting to look like the figure in the article, but we still need to make a few changes. We removed the legend, so we have no way of knowing which line belongs to which publisher (`DC` or `Marvel`). In the next section, we will learn how to add these labels onto the graph near their respective lines.


# step4.md

## Adding Text Annotations

In the previous step, we started recreating the following graph from the FiveThirtyEight article titled, ["Comic Books Are Still Made By Men, For Men And About Men"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/women-in-comic-books/).

![](https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/hickey-feature-comics-3.png?w=1220)

We left off with the line graph in the _gg-step3-line-01.png_ file. The FiveThirtyEight graph designers chose to remove the legend and add text labels directly to the chart, helping communicate the trend to audiences. This practice isn't always the best choice, but it works in this graph for a few reasons, which we will cover below.

## When to Add Text to Graphs

Text on graphs is essential to communicating the graph's contents.  After all, a figure without text is just a drawing. We've already covered what information to include in the graph labels (i.e., the title, subtitle, caption, and `x` and `y` axes). Annotations are additional text we place in the plot area to help the audience understand what we're trying to show.

We recommend adding text annotations as long as they aren't obscuring or distracting the audience from the point you're trying to make.

In the  FiveThirtyEight graph, the text annotations work because there are only two levels for the measure of interest (`DC` and `Marvel`). Encoding this information in color aesthetics is helpful because we can set them to contrasting hues (i.e., blue and red). If there were more `publisher` levels, the color aesthetic might not be the best choice.

Lastly, the text annotations highlight the graph title's information ("Comics Aren't Gaining Many Female Characters"). Both annotations are in the same general area on the `x` axis, and their placement on the `y` axis is far enough from the line that the text doesn't overlap.

## Building Text Annotations

To get our graph closer to the FiveThirtyEight figure, we're going to set the line colors with `ggplot2::scale_color_manual()`. This function takes a `values` argument, which we will fill with two colors, `c("firebrick3", "dodgerblue")`.

In `ggplot2`, we can add text annotations with the `annotate()` function. Each level of `publisher` gets a layer and requires the following arguments:

- `geom = "text"` *this lets `annotate()` know we want text*
- `x =` *this is the position on the `x` axis we want the annotation*
- `y =` *this is the position on the `y` axis we want the annotation*
- `label =` *this is the text we want to use for the annotation*
- `size = 7` *the size of the text*
- `color =` *the same values we supplied to `scale_color_manual()`*

```{r}
# click to execute code
gg_step4_line_02 <- ComicNewFemalePerc %>%
  filter(sex == "Female Characters") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = sex_pct_per_yr_pub)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = publisher, color = publisher),
            size = 2) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.00, 0.50),
         labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  # color the axis
  scale_color_manual(values = c("firebrick3",
                                "dodgerblue")) +
  # add text annotations
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 2001, y = .47,
           label = "DC", size = 7,
           color = "dodgerblue") +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 2002, y = .25,
           label = "Marvel", size = 7,
           color = "firebrick3") +
  # add labels
  labs_line_comics
# save
# ggsave(plot = gg_step4_line_02,
#         filename = "gg-step4-line-02.png",
#         device = "png",
#         width = 9,
#         height = 6,
#         units = "in")
gg_step4_line_02
```


Open _gg-step4-line-02.png_ in the VS Code IDE above the Terminal console to view the graph.

We're almost there! We will make a few final adjustments to this graph to change the fonts displayed on the title and `x` and `y` axes.


# step5.md

## Adjusting Font Attributes

The `title` font in the FiveThirtyEight graph is bold, and the `subtitle` text size is approximately the same size as the text on the `x` and `y` axes. We can adjust the font attributes in a `ggplot2` graph with the `theme()` function. We've already used the `theme()` function in the previous step to remove the legend (`legend.position = "none"`).

The `ggplot2::theme()` function comes with many options for customizing the way our graph looks. We will only cover a small number of these, and you should read more about using `ggplot2` in the excellent book, [_R Graphics Cookbook, 2nd Edition_](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/r-graphics-cookbook/9781491978597/) by Winston Chang.

To change the font text attributes, we will set the following arguments in `theme()` (note that each argument also takes the `ggplot2::element_text()` function):

- Change the `plot.title` text with `element_text(size = 18, face = "bold")`
- Change the `plot.subtitle` text `element_text(size = 15)`
- Change the `axis.text.y` and `axis.text.x` text with `element_text(size = 14)`

```{r}
# click to execute code
gg_step5_line_03 <- ComicNewFemalePerc %>%
  filter(sex == "Female Characters") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = sex_pct_per_yr_pub)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = publisher, color = publisher),
            size = 2) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.00, 0.50),
        labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  # adjust text on labels and axes
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        plot.title = element_text(size = 18,
                                  face = "bold"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 15),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 14)) +
  # color the axis
  scale_color_manual(values = c("firebrick3",
                                "dodgerblue")) +
  # add text annotations
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 2001, y = .47,
           label = "DC", size = 7,
           color = "dodgerblue") +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 2002, y = .25,
           label = "Marvel", size = 7,
           color = "firebrick3") +
  # add labels
  labs_line_comics
# save
# ggsave(plot = gg_step5_line_03,
#         filename = "gg-step5-line-03.png",
#         device = "png",
#         width = 9,
#         height = 6,
#         units = "in")
gg_step5_line_03
```

Open _gg-step5-line-03.png_ in the VS Code IDE above the Terminal console to view the graph.

Now our plot looks very close to the original graph in the FiveThirtyEight article.
