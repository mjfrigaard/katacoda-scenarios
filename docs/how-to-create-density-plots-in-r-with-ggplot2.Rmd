# intro.md

## Welcome!

Welcome to "How to Create Density Plots in R with ggplot2!" In this scenario, we will cover how to build a _density plot_ of a single numeric variable.

This scenario assumes you've done some data wrangling with [`tidyr` and `dplyr`](https://learning.oreilly.com/scenarios/-/9781492079064), and [data visualization with `ggplot2`](https://learning.oreilly.com/scenarios/-/9781492079071).

## Knowing your Data

It's best to start a project off with a "view of the forest from outside the trees." The technical term for this is [data lineage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lineage#), which:

> "Includes the data origin, what happens to it, and where it moves over time."

Having a "bird's eye view" of the data ensures there weren't any problems with exporting or importing. Data lineage also means understanding where the data is coming from (e.g., a relational database, API, flat _.csv_ files, etc.).

## Tabular Data

Knowing some of the technical details behind a dataset lets us frame the questions or problems we're trying to tackle. In this scenario, we will use [tabular data](http://bit.ly/3aXXB4I) data (i.e., [spreadsheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet)). Tabular data organizes information into columns and rows.

Let's load some data and get started!


# step1.md

## Initiate R

Launch an R console by clicking here: `R`

## Load Packages

The package we'll use to view the entire dataset with R is [`skimr`](https://docs.ropensci.org/skimr/). We will install and load the following packages:

```{r , eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "skimr"))
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
```

## Navigating Katacoda

Let's take a quick tour of our Katacoda environment. In the following steps, we'll be running code, viewing output, and creating graphs. To accomplish this, we'll need to understand what tools are at our disposal.

### Sidebar

You're reading this in the *Sidebar*. All of the instructions are in the Sidebar, and at the bottom, you'll find a "Continue" button to take you to the next step. See the image below:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/how-to-create-boxplots-in-r-with-ggplot2/img/sc-03-sidebar.png)


### Code Blocks

You will also find *code blocks* in the Sidebar. All the code blocks will run when you click on them (you've already run a few above!). See the following image for more examples:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/how-to-create-boxplots-in-r-with-ggplot2/img/sc-03-code-blocks.png)

<h3>Terminal</h3>

The *Terminal* is where the R code from each code block will run, along with any text *output*. We can also use R interactively by typing them directly into the Terminal after the *prompt* (`>`).

Go ahead and try it by typing (or copying and pasting) the following commands:

```{r}
tidyverse::tidyverse_logo()
```

You should see the following output in the Terminal:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/figs/sc-03-terminal-code.png)

### VS Code (Explorer)

When we create graphs, we will include the `ggplot2::ggsave()` function in the code block. This function allows us to save the graph image as a _.png_ file in the _VS Code explorer_.

### VS Code (ROOT)

Inside the VS Code explorer, you'll find a section labeled _ROOT_. _ROOT_ is a folder that contains our new graph files. We can open the _Graph file_ by clicking on them. See the following image for an example:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/how-to-create-boxplots-in-r-with-ggplot2/img/sc-03-explorer-root.png)

The following image gives you an overview of this entire process:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/how-to-create-boxplots-in-r-with-ggplot2/img/sc-03-code-run-png-view.png)

Now that we know how to navigate the Katacoda environment, we can start exploring data and building graphs!


# step2.md

## Load Data

The data we'll be working with in this scenario comes from [the `TidyTuesday` project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), a data repository whose intent is:

> "To provide a safe and supportive forum for individuals to practice their wrangling and data visualization skills independent of drawing conclusions."

We're going to use a dataset of ramen ratings from [The Ramen Rater](https://www.theramenrater.com/resources-2/the-list/). Read more about the data [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-06-04).

In the following, we import the raw data from an external .csv file into `Ramen` and get a `skimr::skim()` summary (stored in `RamenSkim`):

```{r}
Ramen <- readr::read_csv("https://bit.ly/38sO0S7")
RamenSkim <- skimr::skim(Ramen)
```

## Review Data

View the character variables in `RamenSkim`:

```{r}
RamenSkim %>%
  skimr::yank("character")
```

## How Complete Is the Data?

View the `mean`, standard deviation (`sd`), minimum (`p0`), median (`p50`), maximum (`p100`), and `hist` for the numeric variables in `Ramen`:

```{r}
RamenSkim %>%
  skimr::focus(numeric.mean, numeric.sd,
               numeric.p0, numeric.p50, numeric.p100,
               numeric.hist) %>%
  skimr::yank("numeric")
```

Pay attention to the `hist` column for `stars`--it shows the distribution for the values. *Where are most of the values concentrated?*

We will investigate the distribution of `stars` with a density plot.

Density plots are a great way of viewing the distribution of a single numeric variable (like `stars`).

Now we have an idea of the numbers we want to include in our visualization, so we're ready to create our graph. Building graphs with the `ggplot2` syntax can be expressed in the following template:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/katacoda-scenarios/master/how-to-create-density-plots-in-r-with-ggplot2/img/ggplot2-template.png)

If you need a refresher on `ggplot2` layers and mapping, check out the ["Build Beautiful, Customized Graphs and Charts in R with ggplot2" scenario](https://learning.oreilly.com/scenarios/-/9781492079071).


# step3.md

## Viewing Variable Distributions

Density plots use [kernel smoothing](https://ggplot2-book.org/statistical-summaries.html) to create a clean looking distribution. Read more about density plots [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_density.html).

## Build a Density Plot

We're going to use `ggplot2::geom_density()` to view a density plot of the `stars` variable in `Ramen`. We will use `fill` to color the area underneath the density line with `"dodgerblue"`:

```{r}
# click to execute code
gg_step3_density_01 <- Ramen %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = stars)) +
  geom_density(fill = "dodgerblue") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of ramen stars",
  caption = "source: https://www.theramenrater.com/resources-2/the-list/")
# save
# ggsave(plot = gg_step3_density_01,
#         filename = "gg-step3-density-01.png",
#         device = "png",
#         width = 9,
#         height = 6,
#         units = "in")
gg_step3_density_01
```

Open _gg-step3-density-01.png_ in the VS Code IDE above the Terminal console to view the graph.


# step4.md

## Adding Useful Labels

Although density plots create a much smoother distribution, the `y` axis is harder to interpret. To overcome this, we will add two summary statistics programmatically to the labels using the `base::paste0()` and `base::round()` functions.

Run the following code to see how this works:

```{r}
# click to execute code
subtitle_dens_stars <- paste0("Star rating (mean +/- sd): ",
       # use round() to make sure there are only two decimals
       round(mean(Ramen$stars, na.rm = TRUE), 2),
       " +/- ",
       round(sd(Ramen$stars, na.rm = TRUE), 2))
subtitle_dens_stars
```

We can now supply `subtitle_dens_stars` to the `labs(subtitle = )` function.


# step5.md

## Updating Labels

We are going to supply the `subtitle_dens_stars` label object to the `labs(subtitle = )` function. Creating labels this way ensures they are updated whenever the underlying data changes:

```{r}
# click to execute code
gg_step5_density_02 <- Ramen %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = stars)) +
  geom_density(fill = "dodgerblue") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of ramen stars",
       # combine text with mean() and sd() for stars in Ramen
       subtitle = subtitle_dens_stars,
       # include source
       caption = "source: https://www.theramenrater.com/resources-2/the-list/")
# save
# ggsave(plot = gg_step5_density_02,
#         filename = "gg-step5-density-02.png",
#         device = "png",
#         width = 9,
#         height = 6,
#         units = "in")
gg_step5_density_02
```

Open _gg-step5-density-02.png_ in the VS Code IDE above the Terminal console to view the graph.

An essential part of effective communication is *knowing your audience*. It's unlikely these exploratory graphs will be part of our final deliverable, so the audience for these graphs will likely be us! Using descriptive labels makes sure we know what we're seeing when we're viewing our graphs.
